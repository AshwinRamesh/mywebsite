        Hi, I'm Ash. I'm a 23 year old software developer from Sydney, Australia.
        Although I've primarily been a back-end developer at various companies, I am trying to also expand my skillset across to front-end and mobile development.
        My passion is in data analytics and solving difficult problems with clever algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobbies are usually quite active - I love to lift weights, play soccer and go on day long road bike trips.
        My favourite team is The Arsenal, so if you are a Spurs fan, we'll have to find another way to get along!
